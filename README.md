## 🌿 Introduction
PotatoTech is an Android application designed to classify potato leaf diseases. Using advanced machine learning models, the app accurately identifies whether a potato leaf is healthy or diseased, specifically detecting Early Blight and Late Blight.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. 🥔 **Disease Identification**: Develop a prediction system to identify the health status of potato leaves.
2. 🤖 **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrate an efficient machine learning model for specific disease detection (Early Blight and Late Blight).
3. 📱 **User-Friendly Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface for image submission and health status prediction.

## 📊 Data Collection
The dataset used is "[Plant Village - Potato Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)," available on Kaggle. It includes three categories:
   - 🥔 **Healthy Potato**
   - 🌿 **Potato Early Blight**
   - 🍂 **Potato Late Blight**

## 🌟 Key Features
- 🌿 **Real-Time Disease Detection**: Quickly and accurately identify potato leaf diseases.
- 📸 **Image Submission**: Easy image capture and upload for instant analysis.
- 📈 **Detailed Results**: View comprehensive results and disease information.
- 🔄 **Offline Mode**: Use the app even without an internet connection.
